Introduction
============
node-svgchart aims to provide a general interface to generate charts on the server side without any need for an x-server or anything of the like.

It's useful if you want to put dynamic charts on the frontend, yet play with them on the backend. E.g. to create reports, to let users with outdated browsers download it, etc.

Requirements
============
To get it up and running, there are some requirements to fulfill.

* librsvg (presence of a "rsvg" command)
* ImageMagick (unless you tell node-svgchart to guess the font metrics) 

Compatibility
=============
* AnyChart 6.0.10
* gRaphaÃ«l (somewhat)

Usage
=====
```javascript
var chart = require("node-svgchart");

chart
    .require("path/to/my/chart/lib.js")
    .setup(function(e, callback) {
    	//Setup chart using your library. Write to #chart.
    	//Note: The global object is still "global", so explicitly access "e.window".
        //IMPORTANT: You have to call the callback to make it continue. 
    })
    .create({
    	//Options that will be passed to rsvg
    	width: 500
    }, function(err, image) {
    	//image is a Readable Stream.
    });
```
